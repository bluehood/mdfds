- currently TMDFDataSource does not reset after the first run, crashing on a second run
- multi-thread reading can be improved
    currently we do a first sequential pass, then distribute pieces to worker threads
    branch dev changes the access pattern so that we do small sequential passes and then work on hot cache with the worker threads
    it would be even better to memory map everything once
    or to start each thread at a different point in the file and move from there (but this would require changes in TDF)
- bank 55 (HltVertexReports) is present twice in each record and we read it twice
- I don't think the values of a column are resent upon switching entry, meaning that if a bank is missing in a record the "old" value is used. this is a bug
- in general the algorithm to read the banks can be improved
    currently we go through the banks and if they have a known ID we read them in
    if the whole record is in memory it might be ok (performance-wise) and easier (logic-wise) to loop over the known IDs and go for the bank for each of them
      I think this latter method is more lazy-friendly
